The Across Project
=============
The Across Project, is a 2.5D engine sandbox. The goal is to develop a flexible architecture to test different algorithm in many different fields (rendering, A.I., gameplay...) on a fun and open platform.
Even if speed and optimization isn't the primary goal here, they'll be sacrificed only for the sake of flexibility.

I'll try to write down some thoughts and technical details on how I implement the system as I go in the [project wiki](https://github.com/FlorianDeconinck/AcrossProject/wiki).

###Reads
This work is based on several reads : 
* For architecture and day-to-day mind-blowing stuff :
  * Jason Gregory's *Game Engine Architecture*
  * #AltDevBlog [(link)](http://www.altdevblogaday.com/)
* For A.I. 
  * Pathfinder - JPS : pruning algorithm for grid-based pathfinder by Daniel Harabor and Alban Grastien [(paper)](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~dharabor/data/papers/harabor-grastien-socs12.pdf)
  * AiGameDev [(link)](http://aigamedev.com/)

###Libraries
* ImGUI by Adrien Herubel [(GitHub)](https://github.com/AdrienHerubel/imgui), which was inspired from Recast GUI by Mikko Mononen [(GitHub)](https://github.com/memononen/recastnavigation)
* For cross-plateform image manipulation :  [DevIL SDK](http://openil.sourceforge.net/)
* For XML document manipulation : [pugixml 1.2](http://pugixml.org/)
* For 3D mesh/animation translation from several modelers (MAYA being the one I use mostly) to the engine format : [AssImp](http://assimp.sourceforge.net/)

##Project implemented list

* A* pathfinder
  * Pruning acceleration : JPS
* Memory
  * Stack allocator (for pre-allocated memory usage)
